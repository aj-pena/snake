## Description

This application replicates the traditional Nokia 3000 snake game, where a snake will move continuosly within a field and the user controls the snake movement with the keyboard arrow keys. Apples will spontaneously appear within the field and the objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible and grow as much as possible, without touching any wall or any part of the snake. A summary of the rules is:
  
  Loosing conditions:
  - Touch any of the walls,
  - Move onto itself,
  
  Scoring conditions:
  - Eat as many apples as you can without loosing,
  - Each apple gives 1 point,
  - Each eaten apple will increase the speed by 5%, and
  - Each eaten apple will grow the snake by 1 square.

Have fun!

The snake will continue growing, getting faster and the score will accumulate. It will take approximately 10 apples to have a significant increase in speed.

If the snake moves onto itself or touches a wall, the game will stop and your score will be cleared.
